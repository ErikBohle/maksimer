###Reflection
Due to time constraints i will outline the plan for the last parts of the website.

##The sidebar doesn't update to show which page is active, this can be done through either the use of several pages or dom manipulation.

##5 different pages or 1 page that filters.

##Ways to reach "masonry grid"
Currently the cards don't fall in line by size, This could be mitigated through a column layout and set heights rather than widths, but would not fit here.

#The cards also needs to follow the headers width

##Modal
3 layouts changing with radio-inputs.
Same confirmation screen

##Sliders for color

#Icons
In the end the icons can use the same color value as the background and then inverted using -webkit-filter: invert(100%);


##Easy improvements
Repeat less code through mixins and variables.
